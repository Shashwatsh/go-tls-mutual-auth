Balanced HTTP2 REST service with TLS mutual authentication
==========================================================

Siguiendo el art√≠culo [SSL/TLS Mutual Auth in GoLang](http://www.bite-code.com/2015/06/25/tls-mutual-auth-in-golang/)


## Goals

This project realize two goals:

  - Build an **HTTP2** service and a client with **SSL/TLS [mutual authentication](https://github.com/jomoespe/go-tls-mutual-auth)** over **HTTP2** between them.
  - Be able to distribute workload across multiple services with a [layer 4 (TPC) load balancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_balancing_(computing)).

The services are implemented in [Go language](https://golang.org/)



## Requisites

For SSL/TLS mutual authentication:

  - [Golang SDK](https://golang.org/dl/). Tested with version 1.5.1

For load balancing:

  - [Docker](http://www.docker.com/). Tested with version 1.9.1
  - [Docker compose](https://www.docker.com/docker-compose). Tested with version 1.5.1


## Introduction

Mutual authentication refers to two parties authenticating each other at the same time. That is a client authenticating itself to a server and that server authenticating itself to the client in such a way that both parties are assured of the others' identity. In adition to SSL, muutual authentication provides authentication and non-repudiation of the client, using using digital signatures. 

This process it performed with certificates interchange. That is both client and server send its own certificates in connection handshaking, the client validate if the server certificate is valid and then the server validates the client certificate validation. If all it's ok the connection is stablished. After this, the server can read client centificate information to perform client identification.

Because we are realizing client authentication and identification in the service process, we cannot put an HTTP/S (layer 7) reverse proxy/load balancer in front of a service instances. This is why we configure a TCP (layer 4) reverse proxy/load balancer.



## SSL/TSL mutual authentication

The project have three main components:

  - The server.
  - The client.
  - A certificate generation tool.


### Certificate generation tool

Generate certificate:

    go run certgen/certgen.go [-org <"Organization name">] [-name <"subject name">] [-duration <duration>] [-cert <certificate filename>] [-key <private key filename>] [-client [<true|false>]] [ip|servers....]


Example: generate a server certificate for 127.0.0.1 and localhost.localdomain

    go run certgen/certgen.go -cert server.crt -key server.key 127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain


Example: generate a client certificate with client_1 name

    go run certgen/certgen.go -client -cert client.crt -key client.key -name=client_1


Both samples are the certificates generated in sample


### The server

    go run server/server.go


### The client

    go run client/client.go [-request=<numbre_of_request>]


## Load balancing 


### Build service binary
